# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn.  
The model is trained on the famous **Iris dataset** to predict the flower species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.  
The project also includes visualization of the decision tree, pruning to prevent overfitting, and evaluation with multiple classification metrics.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Train a decision tree on a labeled dataset (Iris dataset).  
- Visualize the tree structure for interpretability.  
- Apply pruning techniques (e.g., max_depth) to avoid overfitting.  
- Evaluate the model using Accuracy, F1-score, and Classification Report.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn
